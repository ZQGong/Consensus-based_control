% Multi-agent formation control based on consensus protocol       

About the Project - 
--------------------
This project implements multi-agent formation control and basic anti-collision regulation. 
It builds control laws based on communication graphs and consensus protocols.

Input - 
--------------------
The input parameters mainly include target formation position coordinates, starting position coordinates, and gains (convergence speed).

Running the code - 
--------------------
Run the file "main.m".
